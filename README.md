## React-based Investment Calculator
This repository contains the source code for an investment calculator web application built using React. The application enables users to input their initial investment amount, annual investment, expected annual rate of return, and investment duration, and calculates the projected investment results over the specified duration. Key features include dynamic updating of investment results based on user input, responsive design to ensure usability across different devices, and intuitive user interface components. Dive into the code to explore the implementation of state management, user input handling, and result calculation logic.

Feel free to customize it further to better reflect the unique features and aspects of your project.
